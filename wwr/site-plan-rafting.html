    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Rafting is suitable for all people and not just for experts, ideal for groups of friends, bachelorette parties, associations and clubs that want to have a unique experience.
        It is a highly demanded activity especially to work on team cohesion (team building), communication between staff, and enjoying nature in a sustainable way.
        Thanks to its location in the center of the world, Ecuador concentrates in its territory the diversity of the planet, which is combined with the majestic Andes Mountains.
        The fast rivers that descend from the Andean glaciers are pathways that allow us to see how nature transforms.
        Due to this, the Quijos River has become another of the main rivers for rafting in Ecuador, traveling for kilometers and kilometers with rapids and unparalleled landscapes.</p>
